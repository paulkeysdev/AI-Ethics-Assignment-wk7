 Policy Proposal: Ethical AI Use in Healthcare
1. Purpose
To ensure the ethical deployment of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in healthcare settings by safeguarding patient rights, promoting fairness, and ensuring transparency in all AI-driven decisions.

2. Patient Consent Protocols
Informed Consent: AI tools must only be used on patients who have provided informed, voluntary, and revocable consent.

Clear Communication: Explain AI involvement in medical decisions using non-technical language. Patients must understand:

What the AI does (e.g., diagnosis support, triage).

What data it collects and how it's used.

The right to opt-out or request human-only evaluation.

Consent Logging: Maintain a secure, time-stamped record of consent for audit and legal compliance.

3. Bias Mitigation Strategies
Inclusive Training Data: Train models on diverse datasets that represent the population by gender, race, age, disability, and socioeconomic status.

Bias Audits: Regularly audit AI outputs for disparities in diagnosis, treatment recommendations, or outcomes using tools like AI Fairness 360 or Fairlearn.

Mitigation Measures: Apply debiasing techniques (e.g., reweighing, preprocessing, adversarial debiasing) and adjust clinical thresholds if group disparities emerge.

Stakeholder Review: Engage medical ethicists, marginalized communities, and clinicians in reviewing system performance and ethics.

4. Transparency Requirements
Explainability: AI decisions that affect diagnosis, prognosis, or treatment must be explainable to both clinicians and patients.

Documentation: Maintain a living document of:

Model architecture and training data.

Known limitations and accuracy rates.

Version changes and audit logs.

Human Oversight: Final medical decisions must rest with a qualified human clinician, not an AI system.

5. Accountability
Any harm caused by AI use should be traceable. Establish liability policies and error-reporting protocols.
