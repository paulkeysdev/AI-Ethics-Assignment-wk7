Ethical Reflection: Ensuring Ethical AI in My Project
In my current project, “Sister in Safety”, I am building a React-based emergency response app designed to support women in crisis situations. It includes features like real-time geolocation, emergency contact alerts, and voice recognition for distress keywords (e.g., "help", "hapana", "nisaidieni"). Given the sensitive nature of this application, ensuring it adheres to ethical AI principles is critical.

To embed ethics into this project, I will adopt the following strategies:

Bias Mitigation: Since voice recognition may misinterpret accents or Swahili phrases, I will train the model using diverse and inclusive datasets that reflect real linguistic and gender diversity in Kenya. I’ll regularly audit it to avoid disproportionate false negatives (failing to detect a real emergency).

Privacy Protection: The app handles personally identifiable information (PII) such as contacts and location. I will implement encryption and store data securely using role-based access controls. No sensitive data will be shared without explicit user consent.

Transparency & Consent: All AI functionalities—such as voice monitoring—will be opt-in only. I’ll provide clear, simple explanations of how the app works and what data it uses. This builds user trust and respects autonomy.

Accountability: I’ll ensure logging and monitoring are enabled to trace system decisions (e.g., why an alert was triggered). Any future updates will be documented, tested, and communicated transparently.

Accessibility & Inclusion: I will design the app to work offline where possible and ensure that users with limited literacy or digital access can still use it effectively.
