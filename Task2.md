Here's a well-researched and concise breakdown of **Case 2: Facial 
## **Case 2: Facial Recognition in Policing**

### ✅ **Ethical Risks**

1. **Wrongful Arrests**

   * Studies (e.g., by MIT and NIST) have shown that facial recognition systems, especially those trained on non-diverse datasets, **misidentify people of color at disproportionately higher rates**.
   * These errors can lead to **false accusations, arrests, and legal consequences** for innocent individuals, disproportionately affecting Black and minority communities.

2. **Privacy Violations**

   * Facial recognition enables **mass surveillance** without consent, threatening civil liberties.
   * Often deployed in public without public knowledge or opt-in consent, raising **Fourth Amendment (US) or human rights (globally)** concerns.

3. **Algorithmic Bias**

   * Systems trained on skewed data (e.g., majority white male faces) **inherit and amplify biases** already present in society.
   * The result is **discrimination embedded in supposedly objective technology**.

4. **Lack of Transparency**

   * Many facial recognition tools are **proprietary** and lack **explainability**, making it hard to audit, challenge, or understand how decisions are made.

### ✅ **Policies for Responsible Deployment**

1. **Bias Audits & Dataset Diversity**

   * Mandatory third-party audits for **demographic performance gaps** before deployment.
   * Train on **balanced datasets** that include racial, gender, and age diversity.

2. **Usage Restrictions**

   * Limit use to **high-stakes, court-approved cases**, e.g., after a judge issues a warrant.
   * Prohibit real-time facial recognition in public spaces.

3. **Transparency & Accountability**

   * Law enforcement must **publicly disclose** when and where facial recognition is used.
   * Maintain **logs of all recognition attempts**, with the ability for public oversight.

4. **Right to Explanation & Appeal**

   * Individuals misidentified should have access to **explanations** and the ability to **appeal or challenge** algorithmic decisions.

5. **Human-in-the-Loop**

   * Facial recognition results must be reviewed by trained human analysts to **prevent blind reliance** on machine outputs.
